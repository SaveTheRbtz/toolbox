## Report: usage 

Report files are generated in three formats like below;
* `usage.csv`
* `usage.xlsx`
* `usage.json`

But if you run with `-low-memory` option, the command will generate only JSON format report.

In case of a report become large, a report in `.xlsx` format will be split into several chunks like follows;
`usage_0000.xlsx`, `usage_0001.xlsx`, `usage_0002.xlsx`...
